Parser
------

The parser must fill in the pos and the streamName fields of the Hessian model elements it creates.

Integer, double, ... make these immutable by removing the setValue() method. Once they are immutable, we can
optimize the parser/renderer *a lot* by using arrays of predefined constants. Eg. integers 1-50 could be
generated in advance. A static factory method could look these up using an array lookup. If there
is no predefined int, a new one will be generated using normal way. Object creation would
be reduced by a number of factors.

Fill in representative stream name in the Hessian objects. Leave the pos on 0.
